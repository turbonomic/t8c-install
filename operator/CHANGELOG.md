Compatibility Matrix
--------------------

This section will list which t8c-operator version is shipped with which Turbo platform release.  
This doesn't mean that from a specific Turbo release the customer needs to use that specific 
operator version (even if we recommend it).  
As a guideline, an old operator version can be used, but compatibility is guaranteed only when the 
major version is the same one. In this case, Turbo will work, but extra functionality might not 
(see the changelog list above for details).  
If an old operator with a major version difference is used, then expect breaking changes, as 
illustrated in the changelog, and follow the instructions to change the CR, in order to upgrade 
to newer versions.
