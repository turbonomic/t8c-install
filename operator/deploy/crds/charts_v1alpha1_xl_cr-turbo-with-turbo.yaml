  # This configuration file is used as an example on how to enable monitoring Turbonomic with Turbonomic.
  #
  # Monitor Turbonomic with Turbonomic is achieved by enabling the following components:
  # - kubeturbo
  # - prometurbo, which packages the turbodif probe by default
  # - prometheus
  # - prometheus-mysql-exporter
  #
  # Please make sure to:
  # - Apply the cluster-role.yaml and the cluster-role-binding.yaml. This is needed for the
  #   t8c-operator to create clusterroles and clusterrolebindings required by prometheus and kubeturbo.
  # - For appliance install ONLY: Enable prometheus-mysql-exporter, and set mysql.user and mysql.pass
  #   in order for prometheus-mysql-exporter to login to the database.
